# How to patch your Echo VR install on Quest Standalone

These are the steps that worked for me - your mileage may vary.

### Step 0: Preparation

Have your quest in developer mode, and have sidequest installed on your PC. If you have Echo VR installed already, uninstall it. 

### Step 1: Download base game files

Download the APK and OBB from here: https://mega.nz/folder/iBMgXb7Z  
password: `DFY_2VG4QyJ5vH3ffJNP1Q`

### Step 2: File transfer

In sidequest, open the file browser.  
First, place the APK file in downloads or somewhere similarly easy to access.  
Next, go to `/Android/obb/`.  
Create a new folder `com.readyatdawn.r15`.  
Place the OBB file into this folder.  

### Step 3: Install the patch tool

Download is at https://github.com/Aldin101/Cross-Platform-Echo-Relay-Quest-Patcher/releases/latest

**Step 4: Patch the APK**
Open the patcher from your unknown sources. Set up your username and password. Select the Echo Arena/Combat Server at the top of the list. Import the APK you placed earlier and patch it. The patched APK should be in your Downloads folder when it finishes.

### Step 5: Install the patched APK
Transfer the file back to the PC and install the patched APK. 

### Step 6: Restart
Restart the headset. 

### Step 7: Open Echo
If you previously owned Echo VR, it will appear on the home screen. When you open the app, you will recieve a prompt. **DO NOT** press the "restore" button! Press "Open App" instead.  

### Step 8 (optional but useful): Install Spark Mini
Spark mini allows you to join private lobbies with a link:
